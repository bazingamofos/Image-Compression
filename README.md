# JPEG-Compression
## Aim 
To evaluate the impact of JPEG compression on image file size and visual quality. The program should
prompt the user to input parameters such as the binary or colour image.

## Software 
Jupyter Notebook

## Features of the code
• Folder paths are hardcoded for user convenience, reducing the need for manual input.
• The program allows the user to provide either a custom binary matrix or a colour image as input,
meeting the requirements of the problem statement.
• Error handling methods are implemented throughout the code to ensure proper handling of invalid user
inputs for both array entries and file names.
